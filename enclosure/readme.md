With the settings below, each print takes approximately 1.6 hours, including bottom case and lid.

## Recommended settings
The 3d prints have been successfully tested on a Prusa Mini 3d printer. These settings were used:

| Feature     | Value |
| ---      | ---       |
| Rafts | No        |
| Supports     | No        |
| Resolution     | 0.2mm       |
| Infill     | 20%        |
| Filament type     | PLA        |
| Filament color     | White + translucent        |

## Adding brass screw inserts
To faciliate frequent removal of the board without damaging the PLA, brass threaded inserts were hot melted into the plastic standoffs on the case. These can be bought from Adafruit, Digikey or other distributers.
